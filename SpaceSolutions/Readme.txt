Improvements:

Can be improved by making the program async/multi-threaded
Better error handling
Implementing the bonus tasks
Implement method to read firsst couple of lines of csv file to detect csv delimiter instead of hardcoded
Implement method to parse the user sender email and create the appropriate smtp client
put result csv in separate unique directory(get local date and time for it) to stop results from messing up subsequent runs

Why this was not implemented:
Went over the time I had assignment to myself to complete the assignment
